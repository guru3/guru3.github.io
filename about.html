									<p>Hi there!</p>
									<p>I am currently working as FICC Systematic Market Making Strat at <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/"><span style='font-weight:bold'>Goldman Sachs</span></a>, Bangalore. I graduated from <a href="https://home.iitd.ac.in/"><span style='font-weight:bold'>IIT Delhi</span></a> with Bachelors in <a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/"><span style='font-weight:bold'>Computer Science and Engineering</span></a> in 2017!</p>
									<p>Done with the background, now on to story I really want to share! Every single day I fall more in love in coding and data science! It all started with me playing around with the turtle in visual basic in my 6th standard. That was the first time, I was completely blown away with power of code, always wondering how them chips and clicks do all this! Over next few years, I had natural inclination towards mathematics! Fast forward a decade and I was studying Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Delhi ( hands down the best engineering institution of India ) where I discover algorithms and I fall more in love with it.</p>
									<blockquote>If you were to do something for free for the rest of your life, what would you want to do?</blockquote>
									<p>As my B.Tech project, I started working with Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth on the Analysis of Indian Corporate Network. Surprisingly, we found that people's networks within companies were way 
									more powerful in building this nexus. Then one day, I walk into my dark room and accidently step on my laptop and its hard disk crashed with no backup of my code. I re-wrote all code from scratch! That proved it for me, coding and analysis of data is ❤️</br>
									Later I accepted the P.P.O. offer from Goldman Sachs after my internship there, and I couldn't stop myself chasing bugs in the code. I realized that
									<blockquote>One doesn't truly love coding, if the person doesn't love the debugging!</blockquote>
									<p>After giving much thought, I now know that DATA and CODING gives me the rush. I know that most suitable field for me thus is Data Science! I have since tried studying on my own and I absolutely love it!</p>
